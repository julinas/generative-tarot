College Football and the Privilege of Football Players
College football, Krakauer argues, is the most celebrated activity in Missoula, Montana. It has a tremendous impact on city and university culture. Players on the University of Montana team are respected and even venerated by most Missoulians. It is unfortunate, then, that many of the rapes described in Missoula directly involve members of the University of Montana football team. Allison Huguet and Cecilia Washburn, whose stories are given the most space and time in the book, are both raped by Grizzly players. Kelsey Belnap, whose rape is never prosecuted, is gang raped by four members of the team. Krakauer argues that these football players are given too many special privileges by their university and by the Missoula community. They are allowed and even encouraged to get away with petty crimes, and, when they get in more serious trouble, the athletic department sometimes violates NCAA rules by providing them with legal representation. Furthermore, the culture surrounding college football encourages underage binge drinking and the objectification of women, both of which feed into and encourage university rape culture.
