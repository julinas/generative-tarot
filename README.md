# generative tarot

See paper [here](EXAG_Workshop__Generative_Tarot.pdf).

See presentation slides [here](Generative_Tarot_EXAG_presentation.pdf).

### usage instructions

- Start with a text file *themestext* that contains a list of concepts.
  - In my example, *themestext* was generated by *scrape.py*.
- Run *process.py*. This creates *trumpstext* and *theresttext*.
- Run *maketrumpcards.py*. This creates the trump cards, and creates the first half of *booklet.md* which contains the advised readings.
- Run the Jupyter notebook *makesuitcards*. This creates the suitcards, and creates the second half of *booklet.md*.

### credits

The image approximation used for generation of card illustrations was lightly adapted from [alteredqualia](https://alteredqualia.com/visualization/evolve/)'s implementation of Roger Alsing's algorithm: genetic_approx.py.

### "Media Statement"
Below is the media statement for this project, written for fulfillment of the Computational Media comprehensive exam at UC Santa Cruz.

This artist statement showcases an example of my media work where I seek to simulate an interesting aspect of the human mind. This is a persistent theme in my media-making goals. In particular, I am interested in the creative aspects of the mind; because creative thoughts rely on the way people can grasp complex concepts, I am also interested in how the grasping of concepts can be captured in simulation.

I try to fit together two pieces of the puzzle: the inferential view of theory of mind where concepts live in a network, and the Tarot card deck, a fortune-telling device which curates a socially relevant set of concepts and arranges them in a loose structure. Together, they become a simulation of a “mind” of the “everyman” — represented by whichever dataset the concepts are drawn out of. Materially, I generate Tarot decks — the collections of card themes, imagery, and explanations of the themes that are the essence of Tarot — and I also produce a printed physical deck from one of the generations. Then, people use the deck to perform Tarot readings. The media experience of the generative Tarot is complete when people draw storylines of their own lives and futures with the cards, showing that the deck contains a network of essential concepts that people do use to describe their experience.

The first piece of my puzzle is the inferential view of the mind: it treats one concept as meaningful only in relation to other concepts. This view fits in surprisingly well with the construct of the Tarot cards; in a past life, I had extensive experience giving Tarot readings, sometimes paid and sometimes for free.

***A Tarot deck** consists of 78 total cards, with 22 “major” cards, and 56 “minor” cards. The major cards are unstructured and each have a major theme, such as “strength” or “death”. The minor cards are structured in 4 suits, with 10 numbered cards and 4 court cards in each suit. The numbered cards correspond to aspects in numerology; for example, one represents beginnings and unrealized potential, and six represents harvests and abundance. The court cards represent people of various age and gender. Cards within a suit are then linked to properties corresponding to the element of the suit, whether it is fire, water, earth, or air.*

Tarot is effective for telling stories about people because the card themes and imagery of the established deck are curated in such a way that every average person would find a good chunk of themselves reflected in it, with some stretch of the imagination. Some cultural anthropologist refer to an omni-homo, the every-man, that is represented by the Tarot deck, a kind of collective consciousness drawn from the common beliefs, concerns, and values that occur in society.

In a way to serve generativity, I extract the themes for common beliefs, concerns, and values of society from the internet. In theory, one could get it from any slice of the internet — a Tarot deck that represents the 4chan’ers, another that represents the Redditers, another that represents Medium users, and so on. It is more difficult to extract information from some slices of the internet than others. Considering that technical aspects of natural language processing are not the goal of this project, I took a shortcut. I used the SparkNotes literature section as my dataset, because the information in those notes are already conveniently organized into themes. This slice of the internet is all about the stuff they teach you in middle school and high school about what are the important issues of life, and, at risk of oversimplifying, I would say that most people actually retain a significant portion of that stuff into their adult years (additionally, there is at least some merit for the choice of topics in literature).

I mapped the extracted themes from the dataset into the 78-card structure, and generated abstract images for each card that are reminiscent of its theme. The images for the cards are the part of this project that went through the most iteration. Traditionally, card images are composed of a main representation of the theme, but also other small visual metaphors allowing a complex reading of the card. It is difficult to incorporate multiple themes into a single image, seamlessly (for example, a woman at the center of the picture, who is also holding a cup of water and there are roses at her feet). One could certainly stitch together a collage-type image, but that is an idea that I quickly cast away because, aesthetically, I am more drawn to imagery that is smooth, clean, and causes one to ponder. That is how I came to decide on abstract images generated from polygon approximation of photos drawn from the internet, using the appropriate themes as keywords in the search. The inexactness of the approximation and the use of partial opacity in each polygon causes a haziness that prompts the imagination, but the approximation is also composed of vector polygons, which makes the image look smooth and clean.

After the digital generation procedure was pinned down, I created several versions of Tarot decks from the same dataset, producing minor variations 1) from the randomly initiated clustering of themes to map into cards, and 2) from the random (from a set of matches) selection of photos that inspire the abstract card images. There were also many iterations of the cards so that they look nice given the constraints of printing — margins, size of printed card name, and visual impact on a limited canvas of pixels (Tarot cards are larger and have a different aspect ration than poker cards). These later iterations were done by adjusting the aspect ration of the abstract image, as well as varying the possible number of sides, angles, color, and opacity of the polygons. Finally, they look professional and trustworthy to my eye.

The decks are beautiful to look at and handle, but I also want to see people use the generated card decks in such a way that they affirm: ah, yes, this is indeed capable of telling my life story. This is a target that I assert that traditional Tarot decks are capable of doing, therefore I wanted to see that my audience was satisfied with Tarot readings using from the deck. I did this in two ways: I gave readings to an audience on their academic, professional, and romantic past and futures; I also observed some people who have prior experience using Tarot decks give readings to others.

While this is a satisfying media project, it also leaves a lingering dissatisfaction. Has the project accomplished what it set out to do: simulate an interesting aspect of the human mind; the grasping of concepts? It is difficult to say even when the audience using the Tarot deck are satisfied with its capacity to be the vehicle for their storytelling. What standards does a simulation have to meet to be successful? It is a question that I continue to struggle with. The goal posts seem to continuously move, but perhaps that’s it: there is no point when a simulation is perfect; it can only be better.
